Changes compared to version 0.2.1
=================================

Instances
---------

- Namespaces which are declared in schemaRef elements are taken into account when resolving names.
- Instances are working with two elements of the same name from different imported taxonomies.

Taxonomies
----------

- Prefix of namespaces in instance documents is now starting with ns_* to avoid letting them start with an invalid character (e.g. a number).
